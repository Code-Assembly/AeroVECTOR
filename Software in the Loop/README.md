Create the instance with the name you want.

At the end of void setup, start the simulation.


![Sim.StartSinL();](/Software%20in%20the%20Loop/images/Screenshot_3.png)



Replace your sensor readings with Sim.getSimData() and the name of your variables. 


![](/Software%20in%20the%20Loop/images/Screenshot_4.png)

Sim.getSimData(GyroY, AccX, AccZ, Alt);
**All the data is in ยบ/s, g's, and m!**
**Positive values are positive in the direction of the axes!**

Replace your servo.write() for:


![Sim.sendCommand(servo, parachute);](/Software%20in%20the%20Loop/images/Screenshot_5.png)

Replace _servo_ for your servo variable (in ยบ)
The parachute variable is an int, it's normally 0 and you have to make it 1 when the parachute would be deployed.



**_REMEMBER THAT THE DATA IS IN DEGREES, G'S AND M, AND YOU HAVE TO SEND THE SERVO COMMAND IN DEGREES AND THE PARACHUTE DEPLOYMENT SIGNAL AS 0 OR 1!_**
