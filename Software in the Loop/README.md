Replace your servo.write() for 
Sim.sendCommand(servo, parachute);

Replace servo for your servo variable (in ยบ)
The parachute variable is an int, it's normally 0 and you have to make it 1 when the parachute would be deployed.

**_REMEMBER THAT THE DATA IS IN DEGREES, G'S AND M, AND YOU HAVE TO SEND THE SERVO COMMAND IN DEGREES AND THE PARACHUTE DEPLOYMENT SIGNAL AS 0 OR 1!_**
