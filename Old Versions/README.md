# PID-Simulator
This is a simulator to tune the PID gains of a model rocket that uses TVC or active fin control. Allows to simulate the sample time of your real program, simulates actuator dynamics.
Anaconda and spyder are recomended. VPython can be a little bit tricky, so Jupiter is a good alternative.
The textures must be in the same folder as the main file.
