V0.1 - Initial version.

V0.2 - New and improved anti windup, can be turned off.

V0.3 - Improved wind effect calculations, can be turned off and replaced by random noise in the actuator (+- 1 deg).
	New TVC mount initial state to simulate mounting imperfections.
	Limited rocket's maximum velocity.
	Actuators have been slowed down to compensate for TVC mount inertia.
	Actuator dynamics extended to simulate up to 90ยบ instead of the previous 45ยบ.
	Simulation now stops after burnout or detected instability.
	New default input is a straight-up flight.
	Parameters list has been reorganized.

V0.3.2 - Include a Generic thrust curve.
	Add options for a Torque Based Controller.
	Changes in the way TVC reduction is handled. TVC reduction will multiply the output of the controller only, so the 
	it works with TVC angles and not with servo angles.
	The discretization of the State Space Model is now done in the program.
